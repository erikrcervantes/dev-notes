# About Unit Testing

please put some notes about what you've learned about testing today here.

I learned testing is really rad, but I'm still confused.

Something about red-green-refactor. blah blah 

# API Testing with Alba

```csharp

using Alba;

namespace HelpDesk.Tests.Software;
public class GettingSoftware
{
    // Test that we can make an HTTP GET requests to /api/software

    [Fact]
    public async Task CanGetSoftware()
    {
        var host = await AlbaHost.For<Program>();

        await host.Scenario(api =>
        {
            api.Get.Url("/api/software");
            api.StatusCodeShouldBeOk();
        });


    }
}
```

Write what you understand about this code. What is Alba? Where did that come from? What is `Program`?
